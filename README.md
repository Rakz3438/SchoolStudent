School Management System is a project which is based on basic functionalities to perform the CRUD operations using ASP.NET core 3.0 Web API and Angular front-end including the authentication and validation of the student details.
Integrated Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for basic student authentication and ensured that only logged-in users could access their details in the application.
Worked with Azure Blob Storage to upload and store student-related documents, ensuring that students could easily upload and access their files through the app
